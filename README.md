SenchaCouch v0.1
================

SenchaCouch is a small JavaScript library containing the classes necessary for serving [Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) web applications and data from a common [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) server.  This is ideal for browser-based applications that need storage for JSON objects.  CouchDB, along with the use of [CouchApp](couchapp.org), also acts as the server for the application's static assets (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc.).

More documentation is coming!  Please be patient.

**NOTE**: SenchaCouch has been tested with Ext JS 4.0.7.  Testing with Sencha Touch is forthcoming.  Sencha Touch's base classes are similar enough where it might work out of the box, or with minor changes.
